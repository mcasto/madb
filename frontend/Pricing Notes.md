Perfect. That simplifies things significantly and is an excellent strategy. Operating solely in USD from Ecuador is not just easier for you administratively, but it also avoids a ton of complexity and foreign exchange fees on your end.

Given that you're all-in on USD and using PayPal, here is the streamlined, actionable plan tailored to your situation.

### The Recommended Strategy: The "Honor System" Tiered Plan

This is the simplest, most effective way to achieve fair pricing without needing complex web development. It leverages your authority and community trust within the martial arts world.

**How to Set Up Your Pricing Page:**

Present two clear options. The wording is key because it speaks directly to your community and frames the discount as a positive community value, not a technicality.

#### **Option 1: Standard Plan**
**Price: $25 USD / month**

**Description:**
*   The complete [Your Website Name] experience.
*   For members in the United States, Canada, Australia, Western Europe, and other similar economies.
*   Priced to reflect the sustainable value provided to instructors and dojos in these regions.

#### **Option 2: Global Access Plan**
**Price: $10 USD / month**

**Description:**
*   **The exact same full membership** as the Standard Plan.
*   For our fellow martial artists in the Philippines, South America, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa, and other nations with lower average incomes.
*   **Why we offer this:** After nearly 50 years in martial arts, we believe in building a global community. This discounted rate ensures our resources are accessible to instructors and students everywhere, regardless of their local economy.

### Why This Strategy Works for You:

*   **Simplicity:** You only need to create **two separate subscription buttons** in your PayPal account. No coding, no IP detection, no complex menus.
*   **Clarity & Trust:** This approach is transparent and speaks directly to your community. It builds immense goodwill. You're not hiding the price difference; you're proudly explaining it as a mission-driven choice.
*   **Leverages Your Authority:** Your 50 years of experience gives you the credibility to make this choice. People in your network will respect the decision and be more likely to choose the honest option.
*   **Minimizes Abuse:** While someone in the US *could* technically choose the $10 plan, it's unlikely. Within a tight-knit community like martial arts, choosing the wrong plan would feel like violating the dojo's honor. The social contract is strong.
*   **USD-Centric:** Both plans are in USD, keeping your accounting in Ecuador perfectly simple.

### How to Implement This in PayPal:

1.  Log in to your **PayPal Business Account**.
2.  Go to your dashboard and find the tool for ** creating buttons** (often under "Tools" or "Products").
3.  Create a new "Subscription" button.
4.  Set the price for the first one to **$25.00 USD** and name the item "Standard Monthly Plan".
5.  Create a second "Subscription" button.
6.  Set the price for the second one to **$10.00 USD** and name the item "Global Access Monthly Plan".
7.  PayPal will give you two separate pieces of code or two unique links. You will place these two different buttons/links on your website next to the corresponding plan descriptions.

### Important Final Tips:

*   **Communication is Key:** Use the wording above or something similar. Explain the "why." This turns a pricing page into a community statement.
*   **Highlight the Value:** For both plans, make sure you have a very clear list of features and benefits (what they get for their money). This justifies the $25 price for your main audience and makes the $10 plan an incredible value for your global audience.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Before going live, use PayPal's **Sandbox Mode** to simulate purchases with both buttons. Ensure subscriptions activate correctly and that you can see the difference between the two plans in your account overview.

This strategy perfectly aligns with your goals, your technical constraints (PayPal), your currency (USD), and your deep connection to your market. It's fair, community-focused, and easy to manage.
